It can foster a sense of competition and promote healthy risk-taking, pushing employees out of their comfort zones in order to reach higher goals. For those who are successful in achieving these goals, the rewards of the competition are high as they can gain recognition and experience productive growth in their career. Additionally, individual competition can foster creativity and innovation, as challenges can act as an incentive to solve problems quickly and find new, more efficient solutions. Competition can also establish personal accountability, meaning that employees are more likely to take ownership in their work and be driven to produce better results.  In this way, individual competition in the workplace can be an effective tool to help contribute to the success of a worker.\"\n",
